# Library-Management-System

## Create a Library Management System :

## Following are the expected outputs :

1) Think about the tables we will need to run a library.
2) Figure out the cases like issuing a book, returning a book, checking the fine due etc. Basically need to think  about all the operations which we do in a library and then write down the queries to execute them.
